Ordered logistic regression is the way to go! 6.1 Proportional Odds Assumption For ordered logistic regression, we assume that the relationship between each pair of outcome groups is the same. In other words, the coefficient for variable A will be the same regardless of whether it’s describing the relationship between outcome group 1 and 2, or outcome group 2 and 3. 6.2 Interpretation The interpretation for ordered logistic regression is very similar to logistic regression. Let Y be an ordinal outcome with J categories. \\(\\beta_{j0}\\)s are the “cutpoints” between adjacent categories, often seen as the intercept. \\(\\beta_i\\)s are the coefficients, and \\(x_i\\)s are prediction variables. Our logistic regression model would look something like this: \\[logit(P(Y\\leq j))=\\beta_{j0}+\\beta_1x_1-...-\\beta_nx_n\\] We will see a specific example of this in the next chapter. *In this case, we have 5 categories for adoption speed, and we believe that the “distance” between these 5 adoption speeds are not equal.
